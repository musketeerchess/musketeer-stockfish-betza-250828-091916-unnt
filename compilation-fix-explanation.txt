CRITICAL COMPILATION FIXES APPLIED
=====================================

ISSUE: 170KB executables instead of 1.5MB
CAUSE: Incomplete static linking and missing libraries

COMPREHENSIVE FIXES:
===================

1. COMPLETE STATIC RUNTIME LINKING:
   /MT                    = Static multithreaded runtime
   /NODEFAULTLIB:msvcrt   = Remove dynamic C runtime  
   /NODEFAULTLIB:msvcrtd  = Remove debug dynamic runtime
   /DEFAULTLIB:libcmt     = Static C runtime library
   /DEFAULTLIB:libcpmt    = Static C++ runtime library

2. ESSENTIAL SYSTEM LIBRARIES:
   kernel32.lib    = Core Windows API
   user32.lib      = User interface API  
   advapi32.lib    = Advanced Windows API
   ole32.lib       = Object linking and embedding

3. ADVANCED OPTIMIZATION:
   /GL             = Whole program optimization
   /LTCG           = Link-time code generation
   /OPT:REF        = Remove unreferenced functions
   /OPT:ICF        = Identical COMDAT folding
   /Oi /Ot /Oy     = Intrinsic optimizations

4. COMPLETE SOURCE COMPILATION:
   - All main engine files compiled separately
   - Syzygy tablebase files included
   - Object file verification added
   - Verbose compilation output

5. MACHINE ARCHITECTURE:
   /MACHINE:X64    = Explicit 64-bit target
   /arch:AVX2      = Advanced Vector Extensions

EXPECTED RESULTS:
================
✅ Executable size: 1.0-1.5MB (was 170KB)
✅ No DLL dependencies
✅ Full UCI functionality  
✅ Complete Betza notation support
✅ Windows compatibility without redistributables

The compilation process now ensures:
- All source files are included
- Static runtime is properly linked
- System libraries are embedded
- Full optimization is applied
- Executable is completely standalone
