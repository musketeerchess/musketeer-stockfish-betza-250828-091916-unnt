✅ Completely free and automated
✅ Compiles both standard and BMI2 optimized versions  
✅ Creates downloadable releases automatically
✅ No local Windows machine needed

Setup Steps:
1. Create GitHub repository
2. Upload integration files + .github/workflows/windows-build.yml
3. Push to main branch or trigger manually
4. Download compiled .exe files from Releases section

METHOD 2: OTHER FREE CI/CD PLATFORMS
====================================

- Free for public projects
- azure-pipelines.yml configuration

AppVeyor:
- Windows-focused CI/CD service
- Free for open source projects
- Good Visual Studio integration

METHOD 3: ONLINE IDE PLATFORMS
==============================

Gitpod:
- Browser-based development environment
- Can run Windows containers
- Visual Studio Code interface

CodeSandbox:
- Supports C++ compilation
- Limited Windows support

Repl.it (Replit):
- Good for development but limited Windows compilation

METHOD 4: CLOUD DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS
========================================

GitHub Codespaces:
- Full Visual Studio environment in browser
- Windows support available
- Pay-per-use pricing

AWS Cloud9:
- Amazon's cloud IDE
- Windows instances available
- EC2-based pricing

RECOMMENDED APPROACH: GITHUB ACTIONS
===================================
The GitHub Actions workflow automatically:

1. Checks out your code
2. Sets up Visual Studio environment
3. Compiles both versions:
   - stockfish-betza-windows.exe (Standard)
   - stockfish-betza-bmi2-windows.exe (BMI2)
4. Tests executables 
5. Creates GitHub Release with download links
6. Provides detailed release notes

Total time: ~5-10 minutes per build
Cost: FREE (GitHub provides 2000 minutes/month free)

ALTERNATIVE: CROSS-COMPILATION
=============================
You can also cross-compile from Linux to Windows using MinGW:

```bash
# Install MinGW on Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64

# Compile for Windows
x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -o stockfish.exe *.cpp -O3 -static
```

This can be done on any Linux-based online service including:
- GitHub Actions Ubuntu runners
- Google Colab
- Linux-based Replit environments
